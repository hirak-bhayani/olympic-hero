### Project Overview

 **Problem Statement**
The Olympic Games, considered to be the world's foremost sports competition has more than 200 nations participating across the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.
Throughout this project, I have explored the Olympics dataset (scraped from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table) , looked at some interesting statistics and then tried to find out which country is the King of Olympic Games. The dataset had details of 146 countries with different column features like segregation of number of gold, silver & bronze medals won across the Summer & Winter Olympics, number of games played & so on.


### Learnings from the project

 Some of the concepts practiced during this project were:
- Dataframe operations
- Conditional statement and loops
- List operations
- Bar Plotting
- Mathematical operations
